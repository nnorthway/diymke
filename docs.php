      <h2>DIY:MKE Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Who We Are</strong><br />
        Hi, I’m Nate Northway, I helped bring DIY:MKE to it’s feet through
        building, maintaining, testing, and actively developing the site. I’m
        going to tell our story and guide you through the use of the DIY:MKE
        App. First, I’m going to introduce myself.<br /><br />
        I’ve been a part of Milwaukee’s punk scene for about 5 years now. I’ve
        been playing in bands that whole time, I’ve booked a lot of shows, and
        I’ve organized a few tours. For the last 2 years, I’ve been doing web
        development. I am constantly working on something that I want to use to
        help people. I’ve built a blogging system, lots of tutorials and element
        samples, and of course, DIY:MKE.<br /><br />
        Also on the development team are the beta testers. I could not have
        rolled out features quickly without Jason LeGear, Alex Bischmann, JJ Kaiser,
        and Hal Crossno. They helped me test features and edge cases to ensure
        not only that everything worked as it should but that everything looked
        consistent across platforms. They also made listings and actions easier
        to understand through providing feedback and offering suggestions, all of
        which I am forever greatful. So thank you, beta team. <br /><br />
        <strong>Why DIY:MKE Was Built</strong><br />
        I built DIY:MKE to help curb a common issue in Milwaukee’s punk/DIY
        scene: constant Facebook posts of ‘Who wants to jump on this’ but nobody
        responding. The reasons for non-response are numerous. DIY:MKE allows
        promoters to say ‘Can YOU hop on this show?’ to target their questions.
        It helps promoters know what is out there. <br /><br />
        It also helps bands play out more. A band that is lesser known may have
        an easier time getting on shows with DIY:MKE. It also helps venues get
        more exposure. A spot that is out-of-the-way or relatively unknown may
        become more popular because people book there more.<br /><br />
        And now, with events, it helps people stay in the loop more. A lot of
        people don’t have social media accounts or are working/doing their own
        thing a lot and miss out on a lot of great shows. DIY:MKE is another
        promotional outlet, not to replace, but to add to the powers of social
        media. <br /><br />
        <strong>App Purpose</strong><br />
        So, in essence, DIY:MKE exists to better the experiences of bands,
        promoters, and venues in the Milwaukee scene, where they otherwise may
        not be as intricately connected. DIY:MKE also exists to aid the booking
        and promotion of punk events, including, but not limited to, activism,
        workshops, festivals, and other punk happenings.<br /><br />
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Our Mission Statement</h3><br />
      <p class='lead'>
        DIY:MKE provides promotional tools for Milwaukee’s Punk/DIY Community
        that better connect members through an anonymous platform that protects
        the identities of users and aligns with the underground culture
        synonymous with punk.

      <h2>General Usage</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Types of Listings</strong><br />
        There are currently three types of listings on DIY:MKE<br /><br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Bands
            <ul>
              <li>Active bands that are playing out</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Venues
            <ul>
              <li>Active venues that have live music or host other events</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Events
            <ul>
              <li>Events relevant to the punk community</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul><br />
        Listings are not curated by moderators - they are submitted to DIY:MKE
        by community members through the submission form. Bands and Venues are
        posted immediately, but events are subject to a review period (see
        Submitting Listings: Event to learn why), which can take up to 36 hours. <br /><br />
        All information gathered on the ‘submit’ form is subject to being
        displayed publically - however, users can request information be taken
        down or revised at any point by contacting moderators through the
        contact page or by emailing <a href='mailto:mods@diymke.org'>mods@diymke.org</a><br /><br />
        Listings are submitted at <a href='http://diymke.org/submit' target='_blank'>diymke.org/submit</a>,
        or by clicking ‘Submit’ in the site navigation. To submit a listing,
        select the type of listing (Band, Venue, or Event) and fill out the form
        fields. Fields that are required are marked as such. To submit the
        listing, click ‘submit’ at the bottom of the form. If the submission
        was successful, users will be shown a success message - otherwise,
        users will be shown a failure message.<br /><br />
        If the submitted listing is a band or venue, it will show up on the
        relevant pages immediately. If the submitted listing is an event, it
        will be put onto a moderation list and posted once a moderator has
        approved the event.<br /><br />
        <strong>Submitting Listings: Bands</strong><br />
        To submit a listing for a band, the following information is requested:
        the band’s name, location (neighborhood-level), contact email, Facebook
        URL, Link to music (Bandcamp preferred), other website URL, genres,
        description, and year of establishment. The only required information is
        the band’s name and contact email. It is strongly suggested to include
        all information requested to give the best idea of the band. <br /><br />
        Band Listings appear immediately on <a href='http://diymke.org/bands' target='_blank'>diymke.org/bands</a><br /><br />
        <strong>Submitting Listings: Venues</strong><br />
        To submit a listing for a venue, the following information is requested:
        the venue’s name, location (neighborhood-level or exact address),
        contact email, a description, associated genres, the year established,
        Facebook URL, and website URL. The only required information is the
        venue name and contact email, but it is strongly suggested to provide
        all information where possible to provide the best picture of the venue.<br /><br />
        Venue listings appear immediately on <a href='http://diymke.org/venues' target='_blank'>diymke.org/venues</a><br /><br />
        <strong>Submitting Listings: Event</strong><br />
        To submit an event listing, the following information is requested:
        Event name, the venue, the venue address, the DIY:MKE venue listing link,
        Facebook event link, other event link (such as BandsInTown or similar),
        the cover charge, date, start time, type of event, the age restriction,
        event description, an image to represent the event (such as a flyer),
        and host email address. It is strongly suggested to provide as much
        information as possible. Event name, venue, type, age restriction, date,
        start time, and host email are all required. <br /><br />
        Event listings do not appear publically until a moderator approves the
        listing. The purpose for moderator review is to limit liability to
        DIY:MKE. Since user postings are anonymous, all content on the site is
        the sole responsibility of DIY:MKE. To limit our liability, we must
        review images that could be posted on the site for copyright
        infringement. <br /><br />
        When a listing is approved or denied, the host email is sent an alert
        which contains the status of their event and the link (if approved) or
        what further action can be taken (if denied).<br /><br />
        The host email will never be published. It is kept secure and used for
        communication purposes between DIY:MKE moderators and the event host.<br /><br />
        <strong>Event Types</strong><br />
        There are many event types to summarize what an event could be about. We
        provide a handful already and we are happy add more at the request of
        users. The current event types and their possible uses are listed in the
        table below.<br />

                minimize clutter.

      <h2>Viewing Listings</h2>
      <p>
        Listings are viewable by visiting their group URL, listed below:<br />
        <ul>
          <li>Bands: <a href='bands.php' target='_blank'>http://diymke.org/bands</a></li>
          <li>Venues: <a href='venues.php' target='_blank'>http://diymke.org/venues</a></li>
          <li>Events: <a href='events.php' target='_blank'>http://diymke.org/events</a></li>
        </ul><br />
        <strong>View Type</strong><br /><br />
        When viewing a group of listings on desktop, the top right of the screen
        has a group of two buttons which toggles the view type. Clicking on the
        left button arranges the group items into grid and clicking the right
        button arranges the group items into a list. <br /><br />
        List is the default styling for mobile browsers and this option is not
        toggleable because the text would become hard to read.<br /><br />
        Each listing is assigned a type and unique ID number, which together,
        make it’s unique URL. To view an individual listing, click on it’s
        title in the Group View or click on the ‘Read more’ button at the bottom
        of the tile. When viewing a listing, it’s ID can be found in the URL.
        For example, our first band listing had the unique URL of
        http://diymke.org/band.php?id=1<br /><br />
        To share a listing, copy and paste the URL into an email, Facebook post,
        tweet, or any other service that is friendly to Web URLs. <br /><br />
        <strong>Editing Listings</strong><br />
        Since users do not have accounts on DIY:MKE, listings are only editable
        by moderators. The reason we do not allow accounts is to limit our
        liability and to keep everything as anonymous as possible. <br /><br />
        <strong>How To Request A Listing Edit</strong><br />
        To request for listing removal, our moderation team can be emailed at
        <a href='mailto:mods@diymke.org'>mods@diymke.org</a>. Please provide the
        listing URL and the requested changes in the email with the subject
        ‘I’d like a listing removed’.<br /><br />
        To submit a request for editing through our website, mods can also be
        contacted by filling out the contact form at
        <a href='contact' target='_blank'>http://diymke.org/contact</a>, with
        the subject ‘I’d like a listing removed’ selected. The message body must
        contain the listing URL and the reason for removal.<br /><br />
        Mods will email the original email the listing was made with to ensure
        that the request originated from the source and not a malicious user.<br /><br />
