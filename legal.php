      <h2>Information collection, Use, and Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We only
        have access to/collect information that you provide us voluntarily through
        three ways:
        <ol>
          <li>Through a band or venue submission form</li>
          <li>Through a contact form</li>
          <li>Through direct email</li>
        </ol><br />
        We will not sell, rent, or otherwise disclose this information to any third
        party, except through the public facing website. Any information you wish
        to remain private may be redacted from your submission form. The only
        required information in any form on DIY:MKE is the Band or Venue name and
        the name and email of the person to contact for booking.<br />
        We will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you
        contacted us. We will not share your information with any third party outside
        of our organization, other than is necessary to fulfill your request, e.g.
        make your listing public.<br />
        Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to
        tell you about DIY:MKE news, new services, or changes to any part of the
        privacy policy, terms of use or service, or legal statement.

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit information
        online, your information is protected both online and offline.<br />
        Wherever we collect information, it is ecrypted and transmitted to us in
        a secure manner. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the
        bottom of your web browser (inside the address bar on Chrome), or by looking
        for "https://" at the beginning of the address of the web page<br />
        While we use encryption to protect information transmitted online, we also
        protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information
        to perform a specific duty are granted access to your information. The computers
        and servers we store information on are kept in a secure environment.
      </p>
      <h2>Updates</h2>
      <p>
        Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time and all updates will be posted on this page.<br />
