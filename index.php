      <h1>What We're About</h1>
      <p>
        DIY:MKE was started a long time ago and is the brainchild of Scott Cary
        and Nate Northway. They started this project with the idea of providing
        a center of information which would help bands and promotors get in touch
        with other bands and venues to set up a show. <br /><br />
        We're about providing an outlet for bands and venues to put themselves
        out there to play and host shows. This is not a platform to promote
        releases, shows, events, or anything else - it is simply a platform to
        say 'we're here and ready to play or host shows'. That's it. <br /><br />
        We're also about punk ethics - sorry, Afton and Gorilla Promotions, you
        can't hit people up using our platform. If we get reports that people are
        contacting bands and venues from 'pay-to-play' businesses, we will blacklist
        your IP address. Simple as that. <br /><br />
        Since we're about punk ethics, we're not going to use the information you
        provide to us to market to you. We also will not sell or share your
        information to market to you. With that in mind, remember that this is a
        public site, so there may be some spammers that get through the weeds.
        Though we will do our best to keep these bots and people out, we can't
        prevent this 100% of the time. <br /><br />
        To help ease spam and other unwanted contact, we do provide a few liberties:
        if you're a venue, you don't have to provide an address. If you're a public
        venue (such as a bar, community space, etc), we do strongly encourage you
        to use your real address to help people find your place. Additionally,
        your contact information can be obscured so that all contact through DIY:MKE
        will go to one inbox. The best way to do this is to set up an email account
        (we strongly recommend <a href='http://gmail.com' target='_blank'>GMail</a>)
        which is only used for this site or for booking purposes. For example,
        my band, Anergrams, has an email address just for organizing shows, <a href='mailto:bookanergrams@gmail.com'>bookanergrams@gmail.com</a>.<br />
