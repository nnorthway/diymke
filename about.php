        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>
            The purpose of DIY:MKE is to provide a way for promotors, bands,
            and venues to connect and make booking shows easier
          </strong>.<br />
          We aim to ease booking shows through better communication. With millions
          of social media threads which become confusing, DIY:MKE provides an interface
          that is simple to understand and is aimed only at booking shows. There
          are no show promotions, 'will you take this show for me' requests, no
          advertising, no long-winded threads about who sucks this week. Just
          contacts for booking shows. That's all. Since a lot of people book
          out of the venues they represent OR through their bands, we don't currently
          have promotors listed (but can if you <a href='contact' title='Contact Us'>tell us you want it</a>).<br />

        <h2>How It Started</h2>
        <p>
          In about April of 2014, I (Nate Northway) was in a band with Scott Cary
          called Bastard Cat. We booked a lot of shows (both through Bastard Cat and
          through our house, Scarn Manor) and were constantly complaining that there
          wasn't a 'DIY phonebook' because booking shows through social media had
          become a nightmare of politics and people failing to respond to messages. <br />
          So Scott had this idea of starting a listing service which would serve
          to provide contact information for all sorts of people involved in Milwaukee's
          punk scene, from bands to venues to promotors and even to other related people,
          like screenprinters and tape duplicators and vinyl pressers and graphic artists and
          so on and so forth. Scott wanted a punk phonebook on the internet that was
          publically accessible. <br />
          We're not quite to Scott's original plan, but we're getting there.<br />

        <h2>What We Want To Do</h2>
        <p>
          We want to implement all sorts of listings, expand from just Bands and Venues,
          to eventually include the following:
          <ul>
            <li>Print/Graphic Artists</li>
            <li>Tape Duplicators/Vinyl Pressers</li>
            <li>Screenprinters</li>
            <li>Merch Manufacturers</li>
            <li>Tour Buds</li>
            <li>And More...</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>What's Holding Us Back</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Time</strong>. I'm one dude doing this. I have only so much time
          to devote. As much as I'd love to make this my full time job, without
          flooding you with ads, there is no way I can do that. <br />
          <strong>Money</strong>. I have to pay out of pocket for the following:
          <ul>
            <li>Hosting ($12-$24/month)</li>
            <li>Domain Name Registration ($12-$15/year)</li>
            <li>'WhoIs' Protection ($8/year)</li>
          </ul>
          That's a minimum of $164/year that I have to pay. So, to keep it
          cheap, we have to keep it small. Until funding is established, this
          is going to stay small. If you want this to grow, please consider
          <a href='http://gofund.me/diymke' title='GoFundMe' target='_blank'>donating</a>.<br /><br />
          <strong>Research and Testing</strong>. When I first rolled out DIY:MKE
          as a subdomain of Permanent Scowl Records, I didn't really know what I was
          doing. That was my first web app and I didn't know how to do user research,
          look into usage, or anything, really. So that data wasn't available. <br />
          Now that I'm way more experienced, I know how to do these things right,
          and will use analytics, crash reports, check my logs, and do all of the
          things correctly so that I can improve DIY:MKE every chance I get. We
          also didn't have the know how to ask for feedback, or how to respond to
          feedback. Well. Now we do. So while we wait for these things to roll in,
          lacking it isn't helping us, either.<br /><br />
          <strong>Knowledge</strong>. There were things I couldn't do a year ago
          that I'd have liked to but didn't have the know how to do. Now that I'm
          more experienced, I'll certainly be implementing these things as I look
          through my notes from that time period (yes, I keep VERY meticulous notes, in
          a real notebook).

        <h2>How You Can Help</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Donate</strong>. Since money is a big part of what's stopping
          us from growing, the more we have, the better this can be. As explained
          above, hosting, domain name registration, WhoIs protection, and possible
          licensing fees can make this expensive. So, the less this costs for me,
          the better it will be.

        <h2>The Long Term</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Right Now</strong>, this thing works. The backend is a little
          wonkey because I assembled it on a holiday weekends. But it works.
          Thinking of the future, though, there are some things I want to do:
          <ul>
            <li>Build a better back-end</li>
            <li>More list categories (as mentioned above)</li>
            <li>Improve design &amp; UI</li>
            <li>Integration with other platforms, such as social media, Gmail, and a few other tools</li>
            <li>Integration with Bandcamp</li>
            <li>User profiles (to edit/delete your listings)</li>
          </ul>
          There are other things on the horizon, but these are things that I think
          are immediately attainable with a few hours put in every week.
